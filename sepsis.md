**Sepsis**, a dysregulated immune-mediated host response to infection, is prevalent, lethal, and costly (1â€“4). Recent literature suggests that early and appropriate antibiotic therapy is the main factor predicting sepsis outcomes (5). Identifying those at risk for sepsis and initiating appropriate treatment, prior to any clinical manifestations, would have a significant impact on the overall mortality and cost burden of sepsis.
