    <div class="container content">
        <p>I've been working at my current job for over a month now, and so far
it's been way different than my last one. My last company was a tiny
startup, so it was just me and two other guys in a tiny room big enough
for a few desks. Now, I'm at a large public enterprise company. The
aisle that I sit in has more people than my last company. Here are some
of the differences that I've noticed.</p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p><strong>Then</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I saw the same two people every single day. Occasionally we'd have
    some part-time people come in.</li>
<li>When one of them wasn't there for a day, it was very noticeable.</li>
<li>I pretty much knew what everyone else was up to, and if not I could
    just spin in my chair and ask them.</li>
<li>Our business, product, and engineering departments each took up
    maybe 30 square feet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My office has 40+ people (our NY office is relatively new).</li>
<li>I still don't know half of them, since they're salespeople and I
    never interact with them. I have absolutely no idea what some of
    them do on a day to day basis.</li>
<li>We have junior engineers, senior engineers, engineering managers,
    product managers, marketing people, sales people, client relations
    people, designers, and vice presidents</li>
<li>Even within our engineers, I have very limited knowledge about what
    the other teams are working on.</li>
<li>The other week, our CEO showed up, and I had no idea who he was.</li>
<li>Our main headquarters, in Austin, has <em>multiple floors</em> of a large
    building.</li>
<li>And finally, there are people here who are <em>not</em> male Cornell
    graduates in their 20s</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engineering</h3>
<p><strong>Then</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I pretty much had to solve all problems on my own. When in doubt,
    Google.</li>
<li>My decision was the ultimate decision. If I was wrong, well, that
    sucks.</li>
<li>I could get away with writing maybe not the best code, because I was
    basically the only one who saw it.</li>
<li>I could pretty much work on whatever item or feature I wanted to
    since there wouldn't be any conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I have a Javascript question, all I have to do is ask the dude
    next to me. If I have a Java question, all I have to do is ask the
    dude behind me. If I have an AWS question, there's another dude for
    that.</li>
<li>Since I actually have team members now, I have to coordinate with
    them and divide up work.</li>
<li>People smarter than me will tell me if I'm doing something the wrong
    way.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p><strong>Then</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wore shorts, came in at 11, ate chipotle</li>
<li>Google apps, Asana, pirated Photoshop</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wear shorts, come in at 11, eat chipotle</li>
<li>We have free snacks in the kitchen!</li>
<li>Unfortunately, being an enterprise means you have to use things like
    Outlook and Jira, and pay for Photoshop</li>
</ul>
