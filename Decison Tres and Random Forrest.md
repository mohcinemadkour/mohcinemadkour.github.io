#rpart

This package includes several example sets of data that can be used for recursive partitioning and regression trees.  Categorical or continuous variables can be used depending on whether one wants classification trees or *regression trees*. This package as well at the *tree package* are probably the two go-to packages for trees.  However, care should be taken as the tree package and the rpart package can produce very different results.
