To do this, we will build a Cat/Dog image classifier using a deep learning algorithm called convolutional neural network. This post is divided into 2 main parts. The first part covers some core concepts behind deep learning, while the second part is structured in a hands-on tutorial format. We will use some Python code and a popular open source deep learning framework called Caffe to build the classifier.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
