MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation tool for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Google presented this in a paper in 2004 and now in the world of big data, processing petabytes of data seem easy. Later in 2010, another paper by Matei Zaharia added Spark. Thus, Spark came into existence and became Apacheâ€™s top-level project in 2014.
