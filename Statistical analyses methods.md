#Statistical analyses. 

- Diagnostic performance of risk prediction algorithm. We will examine the sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio and positive predictive value of the AKI alerts designed to detect AKI compared to gold standard, the clinical diagnosis of AKI. 

***We will use clinical adjudication of AKI and CKD for 200 randomly selected cases by independent nephrologists as a gold standard.


- *AKI Alert frequency*. We will determine the expected daily and monthly frequency of alerts across the different medical services and at different levels of care (general wards, IMC and ICU).


- *AKI awareness and diagnostic errors*. We will determine the prevalence of missed AKI diagnosis by comparing AKI alerts with daily problem list and discharge summaries, nephrology consult pattern and schedule post- discharge follow-up with nephrology.

- *AKI progression and drug errors*. We will determine prevalence of AKI diagnosed by algorithm, progression between different stages and exposure to nephrotoxic medications inspite of the diagnosis of AKI.
