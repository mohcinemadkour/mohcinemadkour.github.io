These AI/ML cheat sheets are a great way for beginners to get their mind oriented to the many possible ways machine learning and AI are accomplished from a data composition perspective. Each diagram reveals only the AI/ML algorithms that it implements; therefore taken together, they do not present an exhaustive list of the full AI/ML landscape. However, they will give a beginner a good overview of the landscape.

**XGBoost** is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. The same code runs on major distributed environment (Hadoop, SGE, MPI) and can solve problems beyond billions of examples.

**Kaggle** runs programming contests to crowdsource machine learning solutions. Offers forums, a database of public datasets, tutorials, and machine learning job. Start with the Titanic challenge and grow from there.
