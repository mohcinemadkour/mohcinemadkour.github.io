<h2>Installing and loading required packages</h2>
<p>At first glance, this section might look a little bit more complicated then it need be, since executing library(packagename) is already sufficient to load required R packages if they are already installed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if (!require(&quot;gplots&quot;)) {
install.packages(&quot;gplots&quot;, dependencies = TRUE)
library(gplots)
}
if (!require(&quot;RColorBrewer&quot;)) {
install.packages(&quot;RColorBrewer&quot;, dependencies = TRUE)
library(RColorBrewer)
}
</pre></div>


<h2>Reading in data and transform it into matrix format</h2>
<p>We can feed in our data into R from many different data file formats, including ASCII formatted text files, Excel spreadsheets and so on. For this tutorial, we assume that our data is formatted as Comma-Separated Values (CSV); probably one of the most common data file formats.</p>
<p>When we open the CSV file in our favorite plain text editor instead of using a spread sheet program (Excel, Numbers, etc.), it looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#heat map example data set,,,,
#12/08/13 sr,,,,
#
,var1,var2,var3,var4
measurement1,0.094,0.668,0.4153,0.4613
measurement2,0.1138,-0.3847,0.2671,0.1529
measurement3,0.1893,0.3303,0.5821,0.2632
measurement4,-0.0102,-0.4259,-0.5967,0.18
measurement5,0.1587,0.2948,0.153,-0.2208
measurement6,-0.4558,0.2244,0.6619,0.0457
measurement7,-0.6241,-0.3119,0.3642,0.2003
measurement8,-0.227,0.499,0.3067,0.3289
measurement9,0.7365,-0.0872,-0.069,-0.4252
measurement10,0.9761,0.4355,0.8663,0.8107
</pre></div>


<p>When we are reading the data from our CSV file into R and assign it to the variable data, note the two lines of comments preceding the main data in our CSV file, indicated by an octothorpe (#) character. Since we don’t need those lines to plot our heat map, we can ignore them by via the comment.char argument in the read.csv() function.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>data <span class="o">&lt;-</span> read.csv<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;../datasets/heatmaps_in_r.csv&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> comment.char<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;#&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>One tricky part of the heatmap.2() function is that it requires the data in a numerical matrix format in order to plot it. By default, data that we read from files using R’s read.table() or read.csv() functions is stored in a data table format. The matrix format differs from the data table format by the fact that a matrix can only hold one type of data, e.g., numerical, strings, or logical. Fortunately, we don’t have to worry about the row that contains our column names (var1, var2, var3, var4) since the read.csv() function treats the first line of data as table header by default. But we would run into trouble if we want to include the row names (measurement1, measurment2, etc.) in our numerical matrix. For our own convenience, we store those row names in the first column as variable rnames, which we can use later to assign row names to our matrix after the conversion.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>rnames <span class="o">&lt;-</span> data<span class="p">[,</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, we transform the numerical data from the variable data (column 2 to 5) into a matrix and assign it to a new variable mat_data</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mat_data <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="kp">data.matrix</span><span class="p">(</span>data<span class="p">[,</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="kp">ncol</span><span class="p">(</span>data<span class="p">)])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Instead of using the rather fiddly expression ncol(data)], which returns the total number of columns from the data table, we could also provide the integer 5 directly in order to specify the last column that we want to include. However, ncol(data)] is more convenient for larger data sets so that we don’t need to count all columns to get the index of the last column for specifying the upper boundary. Next, we assign the column names, which we have saved as rnames previously, to the matrix via</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kp">rownames</span><span class="p">(</span>mat_data<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> rnames
</pre></div>


<h2>Customizing and plotting the heat map</h2>
<p>Finally, we have our data in the “right” format in order to create our heat map, but before we get down to business, let us have a brief look at some options for customization.</p>
<h2>Optional: Choosing custom color palettes and color breaks</h2>
<p>Instead of using the default colors of the heatmap.2() function, I want to show you how to use the RColorBrewer package for creating our own color palettes. Here, we go with the most popular choice for heat maps: A color range from green over yellow to red.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    my_palette <span class="o">&lt;-</span> colorRampPalette<span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;red&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;yellow&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;green&quot;</span><span class="p">))(</span>n <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">299</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There are many different ways to specify colors in R. I find it most convenient to assign colors by their name. A nice overview of the different color names in R can be found at http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf</p>
<p>The argument (n = 299) lets us define how many individuals colors we want to have in our palette. Obviously, the higher the number of individual colors, the smoother the transition will be; the number 299 should be sufficiently large enough for a smooth transition. By default, RColorBrewer will divide the colors evenly so that every color in our palette will be an interval of individual colors of similar size. However, sometimes we want to have a little skewed color range depending on the data we are analyzing. Let’s assume that our example data set consists of Pearson correlation coefficients (i.e., R values) ranging from –1 to 1, and we are particularly interested in samples that have a (relatively) high correlation: R values in the range between 0.8 to 1.0. We want to highlight these samples in our heat map by only showing values from 0.8 to 1 in green. In this case, we can define our color breaks “unevenly” by using the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>col_breaks = c(seq(-1,0,length=100), # for red
seq(0,0.8,length=100),  # for yellow
seq(0.81,1,length=100)) # for green
</pre></div>


<h2>Optional: Saving the heat map as PNG file</h2>
<p>R supports a variety of different vector graphics formats, such as SVG, PostScript, and PDFs, and raster graphics (bitmaps) like JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, etc. Each format comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, and depending on the particular purposes (websites, journal articles, PowerPoint presentations, archiving … ) we chose one file format over the other. I don’t want to discuss all the details about when to use which particular file format in this tutorial but instead use a more common PNG format for our heat map. I picked PNG instead of JPEG, because PNG offers lossless compression (JPEG is a lossy image format) at the small cost of a slightly larger file size. However, you could completely omit the png() function in your script if you just want to show the heat map in an interactive screen in R.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>png(&quot;../images/heatmaps_in_r.png&quot;,    # create PNG for the heat map        
width = 5*300,        # 5 x 300 pixels
height = 5*300,
res = 300,            # 300 pixels per inch
pointsize = 8)        # smaller font size
</pre></div>


<p>The default parameters of the png() function would yield a relatively small PNG file at very low resolution, which is not really practical for heat maps. Thus we provide additional arguments for the image width, height and the resolution. The units of width and height are pixels, not inches. So if we want to create a 5x5 inch image with 300 pixels per inch, we have to do a little math here: [1500 pixels] / [300 pixels/inch] = 5 inches. Also, we choose a slightly smaller font size of 8 pt.</p>
<p>Be careful to not forget to close the png() plotting device at the end of you script via the function dev.off() otherwise you probably won’t be able to open the PNG file to view it.
Plotting the heat map</p>
<p>Now, let’s get down to business and take a look at the heatmap.2() function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    heatmap.2(mat_data,
      cellnote = mat_data,  # same data set for cell labels
      main = &quot;Correlation&quot;, # heat map title
      notecol=&quot;black&quot;,      # change font color of cell labels to black
      density.info=&quot;none&quot;,  # turns off density plot inside color legend
      trace=&quot;none&quot;,         # turns off trace lines inside the heat map
      margins =c(12,9),     # widens margins around plot
      col=my_palette,       # use on color palette defined earlier
      breaks=col_breaks,    # enable color transition at specified limits
      dendrogram=&quot;row&quot;,     # only draw a row dendrogram
      Colv=&quot;NA&quot;)            # turn off column clustering
</pre></div>


<p>Update Feb 19, 2014 - Clustering Methods</p>
<p>If you want to change the default clustering method (complete linkage method with Euclidean distance measure), this can be done as follows: For a square matrix, we can define the distance and cluster based on our matrix data by</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>distance = dist(mat_data, method = &quot;manhattan&quot;)
cluster = hclust(distance, method = &quot;ward&quot;)
</pre></div>


<p>And eventually plug it into the heatmap.2() function</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>heatmap.2(mat_data,
  ...
  Rowv = as.dendrogram(cluster), # apply default clustering method
  Colv = as.dendrogram(cluster)) # apply default clustering method
)
</pre></div>


<p>Update Mar 2, 2014 - Categorizing Measurements</p>
<p>I was just asked how to categorize the input variables by applying row or column labels. For example, if we want to group the “measurement” variables into 3 different categories: measurement 1-3 = category 1 measurement 4-6 = category 2 measurement 7-10 = category 3. My solution would be to simply provide RowSideColors as additional argument to the heatmap.2() function. E.g.,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>heatmap.2(mat_data,
  ...
  RowSideColors = c(    # grouping row-variables into different
     rep(&quot;gray&quot;, 3),   # categories, Measurement 1-3: green
     rep(&quot;blue&quot;, 3),    # Measurement 4-6: blue
     rep(&quot;black&quot;, 4)),    # Measurement 7-10: red
  ...
)
</pre></div>


<p>Note that we could also provide similar labels to the column variables via the ColSideColors argument. Another useful addition would be to add a color legend for our new category labels. The code for this particular example would be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>par(lend = 1)           # square line ends for the color legend
legend(&quot;topright&quot;,      # location of the legend on the heatmap plot
    legend = c(&quot;category1&quot;, &quot;category2&quot;, &quot;category3&quot;), # category labels
    col = c(&quot;gray&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;),  # color key
    lty= 1,             # line style
    lwd = 10            # line width
)
</pre></div>
