        <p>2013 was my first full year on Foursquare, so I thought it would be interesting to take a look at my data. Foursquare itself doesn't have great visualization or analysis tools built in, but there are a few third party services that do that. The main one I use is <a href="http://www.4sqmap.com/">4sqmap</a>, which offers a great map of all my checkins. Here's what my 2013 looked like:</p>
<p><img alt="Checkins in 2013" src="/images/foursquare-places-2013.png"></p>
<p>I didn't really leave the northeast, except for a trip to Austin.</p>
<h3>Data extraction</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, 4sqmap doesn't have a way to view your checkin data by date. So, I decided to just do it myself. I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/FloorLamp/8273330" target="_blank">this python script</a> to grab my year of checkins and process it. It does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gets all checkins from 1/1/13 to 12/31/13</li>
<li>Gets total number of checkins for each venue and sorts it</li>
<li>Gets total number of checkins for each category and sorts it</li>
<li>Gets the root category that each category belongs to</li>
<li>For each week, gets total number of checkins per root category</li>
<li>Dumps everything to csv files</li>
</ul>
<p>The script contains a few too many for-comprehensions, but it works.</p>
<h3>Venues and categories</h3>
<p>Here are my top venues for the year (if you didn't know, I'm a fan of Chipotle):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>39 Chipotle Mexican Grill
23 Cafe Bistro
11 Starbucks
11 Tina&#39;s Cuban Cuisine
8  La Vie En Szechuan
7  5th Ave Empire Cafe
6  BonChon Chicken
5  Halal cart
4  Cafe CD
4  Minar
</pre></div>


<p>And my top categories:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>48 Mexican Restaurant
27 Chinese Restaurant
27 Office
27 Bar
24 Deli / Bodega
15 Korean Restaurant
13 Coffee Shop
13 Thai Restaurant
12 Cuban Restaurant
12 Burger Joint
10 Tech Startup
10 Sandwich Place
9  Park
9  American Restaurant
8  Asian Restaurant
</pre></div>


<h3>Lunch</h3>
<p>With the exception of Chipotle and Starbucks, all of my top venues are places I went for lunch during the first half of the year. I went to a lot of the same places multiple times.</p>
<p><img alt="Lunches, part 1" src="/images/lunches-first.png"></p>
<p>This map shows my lunch spots from January to June. Almost all of them fall within a 4 block radius of my office, which was located at 34th and 5th. That's also where the Empire State Building is, or as I like to call it, the Chipotle building, since there's a Chipotle at ground level.</p>
<p>In September I started a new job at Union Square. I decided to be more adventurous this time, and went to Chipotle once a week and a new place the rest of the week. Here were the results:</p>
<p><img alt="Lunches, part 1" src="/images/lunches-second.png"></p>
<p>Now, the furthest I went was 8 blocks, or twice as far as before. This is a necessary evil of going to new places all the time. Union Square is awesome because it has <em>so much stuff</em>, but I'm slowly running out of new places to go. Eventually I'll have to start taking the subway up or down a stop, just to get lunch.</p>
<h3>Categories over time</h3>
<p><a href="/images/categories-over-time.png"><img alt="Lunches, part 1" src="/images/categories-over-time.png"></a></p>
<p>This is the weekly snapshot of my checkins. There's a few trends I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like food</li>
<li>There was a spike in offices and tech startups in July, when I was interviewing</li>
<li>The spike on 2/3 was when I went to a bunch of tourist places</li>
<li>The spike in 'food' on 6/30 was because I went on a wine tour, and wineries count as food</li>
<li>The huge spike on 9/1 was when I went to Austin</li>
<li>The only thing I did at the end of the year was drink</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>My main take away from this is that I really, <em>really</em> like Chipotle. I was the mayor of the 34th Street Chipotle until I stopped working there. I'm currently the mayor of the Union Square Broadway Chipotle, with a 15-week checkin streak.</p>
<p>A lot of people dislike Foursquare and say that it's not necessary or not useful, that Yelp or Google are better, that checkins are too much of a hassle, etc. That's fine - I agree with most of those points. I only use it as a personal log of where I've been. The gamification, tips, recommendations and all that are secondary. As long as checkins remain easy, I will keep using Foursquare.</p>
