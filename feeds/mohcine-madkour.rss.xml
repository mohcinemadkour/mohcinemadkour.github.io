Reinforcement Learning is said to be the hope of true artificial intelligence. And it is rightly said so, because the potential that Reinforcement Learning possesses is immense.
Reinforcement learning refers to goal-oriented algorithms, which learn how …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Mohcine Madkour</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jun 2018 13:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mohcinemadkour.github.io,2018-06-14:/posts/2018/06/Deep Reinforcement Learning/</guid><category>Deep Reinforcement Learning</category></item><item><title>The role of unit tests in test automation</title><link>https://mohcinemadkour.github.io/posts/2017/08/The%20role%20of%20unit%20tests%20in%20test%20automation/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Unit testing is a software development and testing approach in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently tested to see if they are operating properly. Unit testing can be done manually but is usually automated.

Each point of the ROC curve (i.e. threshold) corresponds to specific values of sensitivity and specificity.

They are interrelated with many temporal relations. The grouping of medical events onto temporal clusters is a key to applications such as longitudinal studies, clinical question answering, and information retrieval …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Mohcine Madkour</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2015 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mohcinemadkour.github.io,2015-02-18:/posts/2015/02/Temporal clinical events clustering/</guid><category>K-means</category><category>data visualization</category><category>VAERS Reports</category></item></channel></rss>
