        <p>Events in clinical narratives are naturally associated with medical trials such as surgery, vaccination, lab test,
medication, medical procedure, diagnosis, and they are interrelated with many temporal relations, however it is difficult to define
these events quantitatively or consistently in coarse time-bins (e.g. before vaccination, after admission). The grouping of medical
events onto temporal clusters is a key to applications such as longitudinal studies, clinical question answering, and information
retrieval. In this paper, we developed two algorithms based on Min-conflicts and K-means to enable labeling a sequence of medical
events with predefined time-bins. The computation is based solely on temporal similarity and integrated with a timeline visualization
tool</p>
<p>TEMPORAL CLUSTERING OF EVENT</p>
<p>The previous section demonstrated finding crisp assignments of
events’ temporal endpoints. In this section, we investigate the task of
tagging a sequence of events using a clustering algorithm. For this
purpose we assume that each medical note can be associated with a
predefined set of coarse of times that we refer to as time bins. For
our example of VAERS note, the potential time-bins are: “before
vaccination”, “soon after vaccination”, and “way after vaccination”.
The time-bin “before vaccination” is intended to capture past
medical history of the patient including the medical state of the
patient on time of vaccination; “soon after vaccination” captures
medical events that occurred immediately after the vaccination; and
“way after vaccination” captures medical events that occurred after
an extended duration from the vaccination. The issue in clustering
events in predefined time-bins is that the time duration of each timebin varies based on the patient. For instance, the coarse of time “soon
after vaccination” could be the first few hours after or a few days
after depending on the general conditions. For that we consider that
related events happen in relatively close proximity of time. We use a
non-hierarchical clustering to classify the set of events. We consider
the temporal distance between events as the measure of similarity
between events of same clusters and dissimilarity between events of
different clusters.
K-means is one of the simplest algorithms for solving the
clustering problem [9]. Clustering is an unsupervised learning
problem whereby we aim to group subsets of entities with one
another based on a temporal distance similarity. The idea is to define
k centroids for the k assumed clusters and to associate each point
belonging to a given data set to the nearest center. A point represents
the time instant of the event or the center of interval if its time
interval event. When no point is pending, the first step is completed
and an early group age is done. At this point we re-calculate k new
centroids as barycenter of the clusters resulting from the previous
step. After we have these k new centroids, we re-bind the same data
set points to their nearest new center. A loop has been generated. As
a result of this loop the k centers change their location step by step
until no more changes are done or in other words centres do not
move any more.
Finally, we visualize the results using the Exhibit dashboard
solution [5]. The timeline dashboard enables intuitive cluster analysis
by user interactions. Also our visualization allows summarizing by
the various types of events information. Figure 2 shows a screen shot
of this visualization. The visualization of the example used in this
paper is available <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mohcinemadkour/Event-Timeline/blob/master/index.html">here</a></p>
