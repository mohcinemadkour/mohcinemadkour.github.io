Shibboleth is among the world’s most widely deployed federated identity solutions, connecting users to applications both within and between organizations. Every software component of the Shibboleth system is free and open source.

Shibboleth is an open-source project that provides Single Sign-On capabilities and allows sites to make informed authorization decisions for individual access of protected online resources in a privacy-preserving manner.

Shibboleth is a 'single-sign in', or logging-in system for computer networks and the Internet. It allows people to sign in, using just one 'identity', to various systems run by 'federations' of different organizations or institutions. The federations are often universities or public service organizations. The Shibboleth Internet2 middleware initiative created an architecture and open-source implementation for identity management and federated identity-based authentication and authorization (or access control) infrastructure based on Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). Federated identity allows the sharing of information about users from one security domain to the other organizations in a federation. This allows for cross-domain single sign-on and removes the need for content providers to maintain user names and passwords. Identity providers (IdPs) supply user information, while service providers (SPs) consume this information and give access to secure content. 

#How Shibboleth Works: Basic Concepts

At its core Shibboleth works the same as every other web-based Single Sign-on (SSO) system. What distinguishes Shibboleth from other products in this field is its adherence to standards and its ability to provide SSO support to services outside of a user’s organization while still protecting their privacy.

#The main elements of a web-based SSO system are:

- Web Browser – represents the user within the SSO process
- Resource – contains restricted access content that the user wants
- Identity Provider (IdP) – authenticates the user
- Service Provider (SP) – performs the SSO process for the resource
